This is an ASP.NET core MVC project which is basically hepls to store products and categories in the form of tables.
CRUD opertions are performed in this project for the creation,editing , reading and deleting of  product and category.
I have used Entity-Framework core to handle data because it is more securable and had code maintainability than raw SQL
